### Ideas
- Unique Block Goal
  - Reward players for building with the widest variety of block types. For example, the winner could be the player who uses the most unique blocks in their structure.
- Height-Based Goal
  - Introduce a goal where players compete to build the tallest structure within a time limit or until a specific block count is reached. This encourages vertical building strategies and adds variety to the "most blocks built" objective.
- FAR FUTURE: Island Cosmetics?
- Environmental Hazards
  - Introduce optional hazards like periodic lightning strikes, random mob spawns, or block decay (placed blocks disappear after a set time unless reinforced with specific items).
- Crafting Restriction
- Point-Based Scoring System
  - Introduce a scoring systefm where different blocks are worth different points based on rarity or type (e.g., dirt = 1 point, diamond block = 10 points).
  - Handicap System - Adjust point multiplier when a player has more "luck"/points than others
- Custom Win Conditions
  - Allow admins to define custom win conditions, such as placing a specific block (e.g., a beacon) or achieving a combination of goals (e.g., 100 blocks + 10 unique block types).
- Post-Gam Stats
  - Display detailed stats at the end of the match, such as blocks placed, unique blocks used, or time spent building.
  - Generate image file for each player? or gen html
- Powerups
  - Double Drop
  - Single Teleport for faster travel
  - Steal Block
